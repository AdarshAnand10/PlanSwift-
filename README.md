# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Pushing Your Code to a Git Repository (e.g., GitHub)

To push your project code to a remote Git repository, follow these general steps in your terminal:

1.  **Initialize a Git repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add the remote repository URL:**
    Replace `your-username` with your GitHub (or other Git provider) username and `your-repo-name` with the name of the repository you created on the platform.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
    If you get an error that the remote `origin` already exists, you can either use a different name for the remote or update the existing one with `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`.

3.  **Stage all your project files:**
    This command adds all new and modified files to be tracked by Git.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4.  **Commit your staged changes:**
    This saves a snapshot of your changes to your local repository.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
    (For subsequent commits, use a descriptive message like "feat: Add new feature" or "fix: Resolve login bug".)

5.  **Push your local commits to the remote repository:**
    This uploads your committed changes to the `main` branch on the remote repository (`origin`). The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so for future pushes from this branch, you can simply use `git push`.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

Make sure you have Git installed on your system and you are in the root directory of your project when running these commands.
